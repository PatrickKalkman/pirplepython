Cheat

One pack of 52 cars is used. All the cards are shuffled and dealt evenly between
 the players. No cards should be left. 

Players are allowed to look at their cards.

A player's turn consists of discarding one or more cards face down, and
calling out their rank - which may be a lie.

The player who sits to the left of the dealer (clockwise) takes the first turn,
and must call aces. The second player does the same, and must call twos.
Play continues like this, increasing rank each time, with aces following kings.

If any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out by
shouting "Cheat", and the cards in question are revealed to all players.
If the accused player was indeed lying, they have to take the whole pile of
cards into their hand. If the player was not lying, the caller must take the
pile into their hand. Once the next player has placed cards, however, it is too
late to call out any previous players.

The game ends when any player runs out of cards, at which point they win.

The game starts with entering both players name. These instructions can be
viewed by typing "--help". The game can be resumed by typing "--resume".



A set of guidelines for GreenBox and one clear version of the definition-of-done should be written. 
These documents are the basis for reviewing session, which should also be incorporated 
into the quality assurance process.
